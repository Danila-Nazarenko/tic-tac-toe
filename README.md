Tic-tac-toe is a classic two-player game where opponents take turns marking an empty 3x3 grid with their designated symbol, typically 'X' and 'O'. The players aim to create a line of their symbols, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The first player to successfully form a line wins the game. If all 9 squares are filled without a line being created, the game ends in a draw. Tic-tac-toe is simple yet engaging, requiring strategic thinking and anticipation of the opponent's moves to secure victory.
